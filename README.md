# Heroes of Pymoli Game - Report & Stats

## The Purpose
We live in times where App stores have gotten really popular. Thus this project was done to generate a report on a sample game's user base. For this project, the user data of a game called Heroes of Pymoli were analyzed to generate a report.

## Learnings 
SQL has been the primary source of data fetching/pulling and is used everywhere to generate reports. But in the recent times, pandas and python have been a significant replacement of SQL. Thus this project was done using pandas and python.

## Analysis
Below is the analysis that was done on the user data. The main file folder has the code that was written to do the analysis and the markdown version of the report.
